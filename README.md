## Instructions for building
This app uses the Google Drive API to backup and restore databases. The Drive API requires you to authorize your app with OAuth 2.0
 credentials based on your application's signing keys. Enable the Drive API in the [Google Developer Console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/) and generate these credentials by providing the SHA-1 for your signing key.

NOTE: You will need to edit the signing configs in the app level build.gradle
